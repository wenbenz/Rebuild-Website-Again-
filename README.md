Looking back at the end of 2019 after not updating this for a while, I'm not sure what I was thinking (probably just wanted to learn react), but this is over-engineered af. That being said, it's easy to update, so I'll keep this :)

3.0 (current)
Break website down into components using a JS Framework.

2.0
Website redone with CSS animation and minimal Javascript to challenge myself in design, as well as improving the appearance; old site felt too plain and needed improvement.
