3.0 (Current WIP)
Break website down into components using a JS Framework. Has been nuked and reset over 3 times now due to project structuring, and framework+tools indecision.
Currently trying: ReactJS

2.0
Website redone with CSS animation and minimal Javascript to challenge myself in design, as well as improving the appearance; old site felt too plain and needed improvement.
